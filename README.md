# Express.js Note Taker Application

## Description

This application creates an online note taker using a number of different technologies across the frontend and backend. This assignment was done in order to improve upon utilization of node and express.js to develop backend architecture. The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. From here, I was able to learn about deploying backend applications to Heroku after designing them with Express.js frameworks.
